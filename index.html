          <p>This a Group of friends that who knew each from various schools arcoss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham" target="_self">Birmingham</a> in England. The name <em>UB40</em> was selected
          in reference to a form issued to people claiming unemployment benefits from the UK government's Department of Employment. The Group name <em>UB40</em> stood for <span>Unemployment Benefit, Form 40.</span></p>
          <p>The ethnic make-up of the band's original line-up was diverse, with musicians of English, Welsh, Irish, Jamaican, Scottish and Yemeni parentage.</p>
          <p>The reason I love to hear UB40 music is because it reminds me of alot of things, also gives the best vibes to tell a woman like their song <strong>Reasons</strong>. One thing is that their songs have a tune 
          that captures their listeners imagination and furthur cementing the group's status as a <strong>Legendary music act</strong> but that is according to me.</p>
          <p>This are the former members of UB40 the ones I consider Legendary Musicans</p>
